# Build with docker / podman

Run build scripts in a container.

Note: you may have to use `sudo` to run the script to have the ability to build rootfs

```sh
# start build container
docker/builder.sh
```

```sh
# start build containers for rootfs building

sudo docker/builder.sh
```

Run builder

```sh
./build.sh
```
